# *CREATING AND ADDING YOUR SSH KEY TO GITHUB*   <img src="https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg" height = '60' width = '30' /> 

## Check for an ssh key ::

open __git bash__ and type : 
```
 ls -al ~/.ssh
```
<b> if you see these: </b><br/>
  ***id_rsa.pub***<br/>
  ***id_ecdsa.pub***<br/>
  ***id_ed25519.pub***<br/>

then you have the keys all you have to do is to *link the key*.<br/>
<b>else if you don't </b><br/>
then you need to generate a new key

##  Generating a new ssh key if you didn't find one

in __git bash__ type : 
```
    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```   

__if you are using a legacy system use:(if you dont know just use the one above)__
```
    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```
 
<p>this will create a new SSH key with the email attached
    but it will ask you some things, just keep pressing enter or you can do otherwise</p>

##  Adding the SSH key to the SSH agent::

in __git bash__ type : 
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" 
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

# Adding the SSH key to your GitHub account

1.using the website:
